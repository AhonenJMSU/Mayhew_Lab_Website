Our lab is interested in learning how the combination of molecules (composition) and the way they are organized (structure) shapes our sensory perception of the food.\nWe apply sensory methodology to study the appearance, smell, flavor, texture, and pleasurability of foods. We also use instrumental methods, including gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry and texture analysis, to characterize the composition and structure of foods. Finally, we build models that can quantitatively describe the causal link between food composition and sensory properties.\nIf we understand how the chemistry of a food dictates its sensory properties, we can strategically alter formulation or process to produce the desired sensory profile without having to go through multiple rounds of reformulation and sensory testing. We aim to apply this composition-to-sensory modeling approach to promote more nutritious and sustainable eating by improving the sensory properties of nutritious and sustainable foods. Early research projects include studying the relationship between apple volatile composition and flavor and investigating the use of volatile compounds to enhance sweetness as a sugar reduction strategy."

    "text": "Abstract\nNovel cold-hardy berries and small fruits represent an opportunity for growers in the Intermountain West, USA, as the harsh environment is not suited for other common berries and small fruits. This study analyzed the fresh market and value-added potential of haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea), saskatoon berries (Amelenchier alnifolia), and dwarf sour cherry (DSC) fruit (Prunus x kerrasis) by instrumental and consumer studies. Fresh and 2-week stored haskap (cv. Aurora), saskatoon (Lee 3), and DSC (Romeo) were measured for fruit weight, flesh firmness, bulk titratable acidity, pH, and soluble solid content. Participants (n = 115) in at-home sensory tests scored these fruits for overall liking (OL, 9-point hedonic scale), purchase intent (PI, 5-point scale), and willingness-to-pay (WTP, 5-point scale). Ten participants further shared insight on these fruits in focus groups. Instrumental testing found a significant decrease in flesh firmness for 2-week stored haskap, but the consumers’ OL was still comparable to fresh haskap. The fresh and 2-week stored haskap received significantly higher OL, PI, and WTP scores (7.7 ± 1.0, 3.8 ± 1.0, and $3.7 ± 1.0; 7.7 ± 1.2, 3.8 ± 1.1, and $3.7 ± 1.0, respectively) compared to saskatoon (6.1 ± 1.8, 2.8 ± 1.1, and $3.0 ± 0.9, respectively) and DSC (5.6 ± 2.2, 2.5 ± 1.2, and $3.1 ± 1.0, respectively) (α = 0.05). The focus groups indicated that participants want to support local produce. The participants expressed interest in fresh unprocessed haskap berries, but preferred saskatoon and DSC in different value-added formats. Hence, this study concluded that there is an untapped fresh-market potential for haskap berries and there are value-added opportunities to extend the sale season and improve the palatability of saskatoon and DSC."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the motivation behind consumers’ packaging choices is crucial to providing insights for achieving environmental sustainability outcomes. Here, we examined the influence of product attributes (packaging type, packaging claim, product claim, and price) and consumers factors (e.g., diet type, demographic information) driving orange juice selection. Participants residing in the USA (n = 847) responded to an online survey including: (1) a check-all-that-apply (CATA) to valued beverage characteristics question; (2) a choice-based conjoint task with packaging type, packaging claim, product claim, and price as the attributes; (3) a question tasking respondents to rank packaging material from their perception of the least to most sustainable; and (4) demographic questions. The conjoint analysis revealed that price was the most important attribute, particularly the lowest price. This study revealed that the most ideal orange juice option was packaged in glass, labelled as 100% recyclable, locally produced, and priced at $1.10 per 12 fl. oz. Not only was glass the most preferred packaging type, but it was also incorrectly perceived as the most sustainable. The intention to purchase sustainable packaging was the most important predictor of attribute relative importance (RI) and packaging utilities, followed by effectiveness perception, which only predicted the RI of price. Thus, for consumers to make more sustainable choices, education initiatives need to direct consumers to more sustainable, yet affordable, choices, while considering that purchase intention and effectiveness perception are key attitudinal drivers."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. We used graph neural networks to generate a principal odor map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for previously uncharacterized odorants. The model was as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: On a prospective validation set of 400 out-of-sample odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean than did the median panelist. By applying simple, interpretable, theoretically rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors."
